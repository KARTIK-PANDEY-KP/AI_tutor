As he explains, the sapling starts to glow softly, mirroring the older tree's vibrant side, symbolizing the transfer of knowledge.\",\n    \"voiceover\": \"Much like a young tree learning from its elder, our student model absorbs the wisdom of the teacher, growing its own understanding.

    "textual_explanation": "Model distillation is a process in machine learning where a smaller, simpler model is trained to mimic a larger, more complex model. The idea is to transfer the knowledge from the complex model (called the \"teacher\") to the simpler model (called the \"student\"). This makes the student model more efficient and faster to use while retaining much of the performance and accuracy of the teacher model. It's like having the student learn the important lessons from the teacher without needing all the extra information."
