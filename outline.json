The room is filled with books, gears, and glowing nodes hanging from the ceiling.\",\n    \"action\": \"The owl points to the complex model on the chalkboard, then gestures to the smaller one. The squirrel looks on curiously, flipping through a book that shows the same diagrams. The glowing nodes above begin to twinkle, illustrating the connection between the two models.\",\n    \"voiceover\": \"Welcome to the School of Model Distillation!

    "textual_explanation": "Model distillation is a technique used to make a large, complex machine learning model (called the \"teacher\") simpler and more efficient. It does this by training a smaller model (called the \"student\") to mimic the behavior and predictions of the teacher model. This smaller model is easier to deploy and use, while still maintaining similar performance to the larger model."
