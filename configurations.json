Add additional details as necessary to align with the scene.'\"\n\n    }}]\n    ```\n\n    **Tips**:\n    - Use visual metaphors like flowing rivers for data, glowing gears for systems, or a growing tree for organic processes.\n    - Add playful details (e.g., animated chalkboard doodles or talking objects) to make explanations lively.\n    - Whatever object is present in the action shoud have all its characteristics defined in the image, good to make the image as descriptive as possible\n    Focus on creating a cohesive, fun, and informative narrative that would feel right at home in a Pixar or Disney short film.\n        "
